# SafetyNet API
A simple API created with Spring Boot for learning purposes.

### Behaviour
1. Reads a static file with fictional details about fire stations, persons and their medical records.
2. Exposes 3 CRUD endpoints to modify those 3 entities
3. Exposes additional endpoints for different queries
4. Does not have persistence (changes are lost after shut down)

### Prerequisites
- Maven 3
